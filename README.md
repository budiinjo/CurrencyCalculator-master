Assumption
1. App is support for portrait mode only
2. App layout is same across different size of devices
3. User can search currency according to currency code or currency name
4. User has to tap on the currency amount to input money

Note: 
1.Setup class is at currencycalculator.mastercard.currencycalc.helper.ConfigHelper.java, as I am using emulator localhost is set to http://10.0.2.2:8080/
2.Due to time constraint, unit test is set to cover up to 2 API test call which is in this case list all currency call and get exchange rate call.
